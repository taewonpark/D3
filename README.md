# Discrete Dictionary-based Decomposition Layer for Structured Representation Learning


Source code for the NeurIPS'24 paper: [Discrete Dictionary-based Decomposition Layer for Structured Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06976)

**TL;DR:** Discrete dictionary-based decomposition that maps given data to the structured representations of tensor product representation (TPR) framework, thereby improving systematic generalization of TPR-based models.
